   <h1>Omitsu's Pizza Margherita for Home Oven ( 200~250°C | 392~482°F )</h1>
   <h3>Pizza Margherita it's the absolute classic pizza and you should try it. It's simple and it's delicious.</h3>

   <br></br>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <h4>All purpose Flour</h4>
   <h4>Salt</h4>
   <h4>Yeast</h4>
   <h4>Water</h4>
   <h4>Olive Oil</h4>
   <h4>Tomato Sauce</h4>
   <h4>Cheese</h4>
   <h4>Basil</h4>

   <br></br>

   <h2>Tools</h2>
   <h4>Oven</h4> (Gas, electric, wood, etc)
   <h4>Pizza Stone</h4> (If you don't have one, don't mind)
   <h4>Pizza Cutter </h4>(Scissors also work)
   <h4>Pizza Peel</h4>(or any hard surface like a cardboard to take in and out the pizza from the oven)
   <h4>Semolina</h4>(This is important so the pizza dough doesn't stick to the peel, but why this instead of flour? because flour gets wet easily and if you keep adding it, it will build a layer of flour at the bottom of the pizza and will not cook nicely.)
   <h4>A bowl to mix the ingredients</h4>
   <h4>A spatula or dough cutter</h4> (To remove the dough balls from the surface)
   <br></br>

   <h2>Instructions</h2>

   <p>This recipe is to make 4 pizzas so you can adjust later the ingredients. This recipe is for cooking pizza the next day, becacuse fermentation is the key for making good pizzas!</p>

   <h4>The Pre-Ferment</h4>

   <p>To be able to make a tasty and digestible dough we need to make a pre-ferment in order to make the yeast bacteria stop growing so much. To do this, you will have to use a container or a big glass so our pre-ferment can grow without overflowing the container.</p>

   <p>You have to put 6 teaspoons of flour, 10 grams of dry yeast (or double in fresh yeast because it's slower) and 100 ml of warm water. You mix it until you obtain something similar to pancakes dough consistency. Then you have to let it rest for 1-3 hours until it rises. Finally you put it in the fridge to rest overnight.</p>

   <h4>The Dough</h4>

   <p>The next day, first you have to take out the pre-ferment 1 hour before, so it warms up to room temperature, if your room is too cold wait until you see it bubbling, because it's still alive. Take the pre-ferment, half of the flour (250 grams) and 200 ml of warm water and you mix them until  you get a very wet and sticky consistency. This is to activate the yeast and also to develop the gluten in the flour. Let it rest for 1 hour. After that the dough will have almost doubled in size. Now you can add the rest of the flour mixed with 10 grams of salt. Mix nicely, you can use a mixer but if you are new to this you better get your hands dirty. 

   If the dough after mixing everything nicely, sticks too much in your hands, let it rest 15 minutes, and repeat the process until it's more easy to handle (adding more flour in this step is not recommended), this will help to develop the gluten (if the flour you bought is low on protein you probably will struggle in this process). 

   Or if the dough seems a little dry and there's still flour in the bowl, you cccan use some olive oil instead of water to help it mix. Then take it off on the table to begin the kneading proccess. 

   This dough doesn't need lot of kneading, just form a big ball and make it look smooth. If your ball doesn't look smooth, let it rest again 10 min and you will see the magic. Finally put it in the same container you mixed the dough but with some flour at the bottom or olive oil so it doesn't stick. Let it rest for 1 hour. And then make 4 balls, which probably weight about 200 grams each. Put the balls in a big container separated from each other, or a tray with plastic wrap.

   Let them rest for 4-5 hours depending on how much hungry you are at this step. Then you are ready to go. (Or you can put the dough in the fridge, it can last max a week but will be very difficult to handle after a week, only experts can do it)
